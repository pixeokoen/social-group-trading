## Backend Changes

```python
# Analytics endpoint now returns:
{
  # Trade stats
  "total_trades": 10,
  "open_trades": 3,
  "pending_trades": 1,
  "winning_trades": 4,
  "losing_trades": 2,
  "total_pnl": 1250.50,
  "avg_pnl": 208.42,
  "win_rate": 66.7,
  
  # Signal stats
  "total_signals": 25,
  "pending_signals": 5,  # NEW!
  "approved_signals": 15,
  "rejected_signals": 5,
  "executed_signals": 12,
  
  # Account info
  "active_account": "My Trading Account",
  "account_type": "paper",
  
  # Recent trades
  "recent_trades": [...]  # NEW!
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **On Load**: Dashboard fetches all analytics data
2. **Every 30s**: Auto-syncs with broker and refreshes
3. **Manual Sync**: Click button for immediate update
4. **Account-Aware**: Shows data for active account only

The dashboard now gives you a complete overview at a glance, with pending signals prominently displayed as requested!
