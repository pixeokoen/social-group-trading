# Simple Trade Sync Guide

## The Practical Approach

After considering deployment complexity, here's a simpler, more practical approach to keeping trades synchronized.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Background Sync (Built-in)
- The main API automatically syncs trades every 30 seconds
- No extra services needed - it's built into `main.py`
- Works perfectly for most trading scenarios

### 2. Manual Sync Button
- Click "Sync with Broker" anytime for immediate updates
- Useful after placing trades or when you need instant confirmation

### 3. Frontend Auto-Refresh
- The Trades page refreshes data every 30 seconds
- Visual indicators show when sync is active

## Why This Approach?

### ✅ Pros:
- **Simple**: Just run one service (`python main.py`)
- **Reliable**: No complex WebSocket connections to maintain
- **Deploy-friendly**: Works on any platform (Render, Heroku, etc.)
- **Good enough**: 30-second updates are sufficient for most trading

### ⚠️ Trade-offs:
- Not real-time (30-second delay)
- Uses more API calls than streaming
- But honestly, this is fine for 99% of use cases

## Running Locally

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

That's it! The sync runs automatically in the background.

## Deploying on Render

Super easy - just one web service:

```yaml
# render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: trading-api
    env: python
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "python main.py"
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: trading-db
          property: connectionString
```

## The Reality Check

**Do you really need real-time updates?**

- Most trades take seconds to minutes to fill
- 30-second sync catches everything important
- Manual sync available when you need it
- Keeps deployment simple and costs low

## Advanced Options (If Really Needed)

If you absolutely need real-time updates:

1. **Use Render Background Workers** ($7/month extra)
   - Run the stream service as a background worker
   - More complex but possible

2. **Use a Different Platform**
   - AWS/GCP with multiple services
   - Docker Compose for multi-container apps

3. **Upgrade to Enterprise Broker**
   - Some brokers offer webhooks (push notifications)
   - Alpaca is considering this feature

## Recommendation

**Start with the simple approach:**
1. Deploy the single service
2. Use 30-second auto-sync
3. Add manual sync button
4. Only add complexity if users complain

Most users won't notice the difference between real-time and 30-second updates, but they will notice if your app is complicated to deploy and maintain.

## Quick Render Deployment

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Render to your repo
3. Create PostgreSQL database
4. Deploy the web service
5. Done! No complex multi-service setup needed

The built-in sync will start automatically when the app starts.
